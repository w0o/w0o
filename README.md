👋 Yo, I’m @w0o, whoohoo
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that moves bits around
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the cosmos, bit by bit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects across any platform especially involving audio, CG/visuals, gaming and art.
- 📫 Reach me **here** for code collab or look me up in your local pubs ;)

Yes, you're welcome to pet the alligator!
